    "Hi! I'm an <u>AI and Machine Learning Engineer</u> with a degree in <u>Computer Engineering</u>. I like building things that make life easier using <u>data</u> and <u>AI</u>. Some of my favorite projects are <u>Onqoud</u>, which helps restaurants understand their business better, and <u>ElmLLM</u>, an <u>Arabic AI model</u> I built from scratch. I usually work with <u>Python</u>, <u>TensorFlow</u>, and tools like <u>Power BI</u> to show data in a clear way.",
    "I've won <u>1st place</u> in a <u>NASA competition</u> and was part of the top <u>AI project</u> at <u>PSUT</u>. I'm always looking to <u>learn more</u>, <u>build cool ideas</u>, and <u>connect</u> with people who love working on <u>smart and helpful tech</u>."
